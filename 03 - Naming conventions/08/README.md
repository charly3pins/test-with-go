# Lesson 8: Function naming conventions

The naming conventions for test are defined in the Go's [testing package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Examples).

For this lesson we have a test file with a few examples of naming and another file with some code used as a reference. There is nothing to run here, just inspect the `naming_test.go` for the name conventions.
