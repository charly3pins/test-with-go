# Lesson 9: Variable naming conventions

Continuing the lesson 8 about name conventions, now it's the turn of the variables. 

Same as we said in the other lesson, this is a common way of do the things but is not a requirement. The good part of doing it is that as much as you use the standards, the more other developers will undersand your code and more easily you could join another projects.

For this example we have a file with a function as an example and in the test file we introduced the concept of `args`,  `got` and `want`.
