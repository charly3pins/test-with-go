# Lesson 6: What happens when we run go test

When a test is executed what happen behind the scenes is that the testing tool is creating a binary with that test for the files called `x_test.go` and the functions `func TestY()`.

In order to check that you can execute the test of this lesson with

```shell
go test
```

As it contains a sleep inside, you can open another terminal window and you can check the processes running in Go with
```shell
ps a -u $USER | grep go
```

You will see a list of processes there but the one that we're interested in is one called like

`30026 pts/2    Sl+    0:00 /tmp/go-build1743238718/b001/06.test -test.paniconexit0 -test.timeout=10m0s`

That one is the binary generated by the testing tool for our test, and we can execute it like a normal Go binary with
```shell
/tmp/go-build1743238718/b001/06.test
```

The thing is that when our "go test" process ends (1 minute for this case) if you check again the processes of course, it will not appear there, but if you go to the folder that in theory contains that binary, it's also removed.
```shell
cd /tmp/go-build1743238718/b001/
```

You will get something similar to: `cd: no such file or directory: /tmp/go-build1743238718/b001/`
