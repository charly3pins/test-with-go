# Lesson 5: Testing with Go's testing package

With the code from the lesson 4, create a test file using the testing package included in the Go's standard library. The key here is to name the file `whatever_test.go` (usually `whatever` is the name of the file that you wanna test, but is not a requirement) and also have a function inside called `TestX()` where `X` is the name of what we want to test (again it's not required, but it's a standard used).

For run it
```shell
go test
```
