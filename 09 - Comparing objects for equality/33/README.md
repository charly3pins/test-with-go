# Helper comparison functions
Use helper functions to do checks in your tests instead of repeating a lot of nil fields across the different scenarios. Using those functions will help you to create the test cases easily and with the focus on the data you need not in the one you don't. The `httptest` has a lot of it in the following test file https://golang.org/src/net/http/httptest/recorder_test.go
Also, if your internal code to run the tests starts to be very complex, consider to move that code into a separate package and add tests there to prove that part is working and then import that code in your tests with the confidence that is working. If that internal code is small enough or simple enough to don't provoke you false positives / negatives in your tests results, is not necessary to extract them into another packages.
