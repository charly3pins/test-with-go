# Building things with helper functions
If you need to test things more complex and you need to build your app, service, store, etc... use a helper functions for it. Passing the type `testing.T` is a good idea to handle in the helper functions the errors instead of propoagating them. If you need to teardown things, return a `func()` and inside the helper return a closure with the teardown function, for example the `db.Close()`. In addition, the `testing` package provides a `t.Helper()` method to mark your helper functions and skip them on process of printing information as they are not part of your test cases.
All that helper functions can be organized in the same package under a file `testing.go` like hashicorp does in terraform's github https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/main/internal/backend/testing.go or in a new package called `yourpackagetest` like the `httptest` or `iotest` from the standard library.
